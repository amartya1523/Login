Run npm install <package-name> to install a package. Replace <package-name> with the name of the package you want to install. For example, npm install express.

If you're working on a web project, you might need to start a local server to view your project in the browser.
If you're using Node.js with Express, you can start the server using node <filename>.js where <filename> is the name of your main server file.
For other projects, you might use tools like http-server or live-server to start a local server.

Test Your Project:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 where 3000 is the port number your server is running on.
Test your project to ensure everything is working as expected.
